"""Lightweight Federated Averaging (FedAvg) prototype.

This module simulates federated training across multiple clients. Each client
has a small local model represented by a weight vector (numpy array). Clients
compute local updates and the server aggregates them via weighted averaging.

This is a demonstrative scaffold â€” it doesn't use TensorFlow Federated but it
shows the protocol flow and can be replaced with a proper FL framework later.
